             <!--text-->
            <P>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s leadership and people will celebrate tomorrow, Wednesday,
                 September 23, 2020, the 90th National Day of Saudi Arabia, after the historical 
                  announcement of the late King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia’s 
                  unification under "There is no god but Allah;  Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah" banner. 
                  <br><br>

                Saudi National Day is the day on which the late founder named the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
                 throughout the country, after 32 years of wars. On that day, a young country was established
                  that prided itself by the application of the Islamic Sharia and its preservation of human
                   values, promoting peace and goodness and in search of knowledge and development towards a
                    better future for its people, the Islamic nation and the whole world.
                <br><br>

                King Abdulaziz ordered at the beginning of structuring Saudi Arabia to pay great attention to 
                the Two Holy Mosques and their expansion and to serving pilgrims and Umrah performers, as well 
                as establishing schools and hospitals, building villages, rehabilitating the soil, and exploring 
                irrigation water in order to support agriculture.
                <br><br>

                Then, King Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was the first to follow this approach and to work within 
                its framework until the features of progress emerged and the structures of a number of basic 
                institutions and agencies in the country were completed.
                <br><br>

                In the era of the pioneer of Islamic solidarity, who succeeded King Saud, King Faisal bin
                 Abdulaziz Al Saud, achieving accomplishments continued, and during his reign, the Kingdom
                  of Saudi Arabia began the implementation of the ambitious five-year plans for development.
                  <br><br>

                In the reign of King Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, building and growth continued to serve the 
                country and citizens in particular and Islam and Muslims in general. The development plans also
                 connected with each other for the sake of achieving more prosperity and stability.
                 <br><br>

                The achievements during the reign of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud were characterized by 
                comprehensiveness and integration to form a comprehensive development process for building 
                a nation and a wise and unique leadership that embodied many qualities that he had, the most 
                prominent of which was his adherence to the holy Quran and prophetic Sunnah, and his dedication 
                to serving his homeland, citizens, the Islamic nation and the entire humankind.
                <br><br>

                During the era of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 
                the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia witnessed more giant developmental achievements throughout the nation
                 in various sectors, including education, health, transportation, industry, electricity, water,
                  agriculture and the economy.
                  <br><br>

                Today, Saudi Arabia witnesses a distinguished present, looking forward to a more distinguished 
                future full of confidence in the title of the stage, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King
                 Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who has been making, since the beginning of his reign, an effort
                  to advance Saudi Arabia. The activities varied in various fields at regional and international 
                  levels, preceded by accomplishments at various stages during his reign in many positions.
                  <br><br>

                Today, Saudi Arabia’s National Day passes by while we live in a bright reality established by the
                 late founder King Abdulaziz. --SPA
